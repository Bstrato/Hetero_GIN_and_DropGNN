**GNN - Project Summary**
This project implements and compares DropGNN(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06283) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00826) for heterogeneous node classification on the DBLP dataset using PyTorch Geometric. It extends the original DropGNN architecture to support heterogeneous graphs and evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall. The training pipeline includes support for hyperparameter tuning, and detailed visualization of training metrics.
